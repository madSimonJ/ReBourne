## Introduction

You are a laser communications operator.  Your job is to intercept robot messages and relay them to Command HQ.  A vital code message is expected.  If you relay it correctly, the robot attack will be crushed.

This game tests your skill at remembering a group of letters which you see for only a very short time.  The computer will ask you for a difficulty from 4 to 10.  When you have typed in your answer, letters will appear top left of your screen and disappear again fairly quickly.  Memorise them and type them in to the computer to see if you were right.

## Adding to the program

* Change the program to include numbers and punctuation marks
* Work out how to make the message to appear on screen for longer
