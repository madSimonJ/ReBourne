# Computer Battlegames

___

This is one of a series of books by Usbourne from the 80s, designed to teach children coding in BASIC by writing out code from the book, playing the game, and then working out how to modify it.

The original books can be found here: 

http://www.usborne.com/catalogue/feature-page/computer-and-coding-books.aspx

They are all the Copyright of Usbourne, but they have granded the licence to anyone that wants to, to re-write the code samples into modern programming languages.

I do recommend checking out the original books for some glorious examples of 80s sci-fi artwork.

I've done this as an exercise in learning Python and PowerShell, but it might also be interesting to others that want to learn as well.  I'm going to include answers to the original puzzles that were set.
