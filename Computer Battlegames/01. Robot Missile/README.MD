## Introduction

The year is 2582 and the people of Earth are inthe midst of battle against the Robots.  A lethal robot missile has just landed and everyone is depending on you to find the secret code which unlocks its defuse mechanism.  If you fail, the entire Earth Command Headquarters will be blown up.  

Your computer knows what the code letter is.  You must type in your guess and it will tell you whether the code letter is earlier or later in the alphabet.

You have four chances to find the correct letter before the missile blows up.

## Adding to the program

* Add an additional message for a correct guess on the last go, so that instead of "you did it."  It says "you did it.  Just"
* Modify the program to give the player more or fewer guesses
